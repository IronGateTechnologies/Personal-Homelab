Notes & Lessons Learned  
- System updates are applied on a scheduled basis, prioritizing security patches while avoiding unnecessary changes that may introduce instability
- BIOS tuning significantly improved stability during CPU overclocking
- Clear drive labeling streamlined VM storage pool management
- SATA SSDs are ideal for disposable VM environments and rapid re-deployment cycles.
- SSD wear-level monitoring and periodic SMART checks ensured early detection of drive degradation and informed replacement planning
- The two SATA SSDs will be assigned to a mirrored (RAID-1) configuration to increase storage fault tolerance and reduce downtime risk
- Files are manually backed up to the NAS server (Charlie), with select critical files additionally synchronized to off-site cloud storage (service names intentionally withheld for operational security)
- Biometrics will not used for either two-factor authentication or system access to maintain maximum control, auditability, and privacy of authentication mechanisms
- VPN connections remain active at all times on this node to maintain encrypted traffic, reduce exposure to untrusted networks, and preserve a consistent security posture
- Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are used only when necessary and only through external USB adapters.
- No PCIe or motherboard-level wireless radios are enabled, reducing the system’s wireless attack surface and ensuring physical-layer control over radio access
- All network connectivity is conducted exclusively through wired Cat6 Ethernet. No wireless interfaces are enabled by default, ensuring stable throughput, reduced latency, and a minimized attack surface
- Hardware changes will occur only when necessary, specifically in cases where upgrades are critical for workflow efficiency, system stability, or essential performance requirements
- Thermal performance was improved through structured fan-curve tuning and regular dust maintenance, ensuring stable CPU/GPU operation under sustained virtualization workloads
- Maintaining consistent documentation across hardware, services, and configurations significantly improved troubleshooting speed and reduced configuration drift
- All major system changes are tested in isolated VMs or disposable environments before being applied to primary workloads, ensuring safe rollback and minimal disruption
- All unnecessary services, background processes, and startup applications were disabled to maintain a lean, controlled, and secure system footprint
- VM resource allocations (CPU, memory, storage) were tuned based on real-world usage data to avoid over-provisioning and maximize system efficiency
- Backup integrity is routinely verified by restoring sample files to ensure data reliability and prevent silent corruption
- Establishing baseline benchmarks allowed for accurate measurement of performance improvements after tuning or hardware changes
