Welcome to my homelab documentation repo.
This repository is a living record of my homelab journey — from hardware builds and upgrades to networking diagrams, service deployments, and personal notes.

The homelab serves both as a sandbox for learning cybersecurity and networking and a playground for tinkering with hardware, virtualization, and storage.

Goals of This Repo

Document each node in the homelab with hardware specs, photos, and configurations

Keep history logs of upgrades, swaps, and experiments

Share wins, failures, and lessons learned (update journal)

Provide reproducible setups for anyone following along

Track the growth of the lab over months and years

Current Nodes

Alpha – Ryzen 9 powerhouse for testing, dual-boot Linux Mint and a Debloated Version of Windows 11 (Couresy of the Talon Debloat Script)

Bravo – Renewed Business Class Laptop HP Envy w/ Linux Mint

Charlie – Storage and backup server

Delta – High Performance ProxMox Server 

Echo – Home Theater PC / Gaming Cener with Bazzite Linux

Golf - ThinkPad T440 With Linux Mint (Field Laptop for Out of Office work in the field)

Hotel - HP Printer/Scanner foor document backup and digitzing. 

India - Dell Poweredge R710 Utilzing Proxmox so no resources are left underutilized) 

(I recently picked up two Dell Wyse 5070 SFF Nodes. One of which will become my rouuter with the additon of a ethernet to USB 3.0 Male to RJ-f5 Female Adapter. The other will likely be implemented in a LAN secuity capacity)

(There are also 3 gaming PCs I put tooogether on a budget in the hopes of selling them. In the event they are not sold they will be utilized as additional nodes in my lab running with power efficent settings enabled at the BIOS level)


Each node has its own folder with detailed specs, history, and photos.
